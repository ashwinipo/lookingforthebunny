    <h3> Lola was a happy monkey until she was used by a facility to test make up products. Did you know, that every year 105,000 primates just like Lola are imprisoned in American laboratories where trhey are abused and invoveled in painful and terrifying experiments that often result in death. Babies born in such facilities are torn apart from their mothers within 3 days of birth. Millions of animals are subjected to inhumane torture just so that someone somewhere could wear some make up or put on a fancy hand cream. </h3>

    <H3> There are ways to ethically create these products without harming animals or using them to test these products on. There are 3 types cruelty free brands: ones that are certified by the leaping bunny organisation, ones that are pledged to PETA, and ones that are not affiliated to any organisation. It is very important that we are able to recognize what brands are cruelty free when we are shopping for products and that is why it is crucial that we look for the bunny! The leaping bunny was formed out of eight national animal protection groups banding together to form the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC) The Leaping Bunny logo is internationally recognized and it is a logo featuring a bunny. Whenever you see this logo on any item it means that it was created ethically and is cruelty free.</H3>
